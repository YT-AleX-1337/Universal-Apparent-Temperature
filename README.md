# Universal Apparent Temperature
A custom formula to calculate the apparent temperature from air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed.<br/><br/>
It's based on these other forumlas: the Canadian Wind Chill formula, the water vapor pressure formula and the Australian Apparent Temperature formula.
It considers the effect of humidity (increased apparent temperature when it's hot, slightly decreased when it's cold) and wind speed (decreased
apparent temperature when it's cold, slightly increased when it's hot).
